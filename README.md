# Human-FSRCNN
Fast Super-Resolution Convolutional Neural Network for human image
This is the final project of USC course EE599-Deep learning. 
In this project, we aimed to:
  1. Train a model to built high resolution human image based on original image 
  2. Make the transform fast enough to do it in real time(20-30fps)
